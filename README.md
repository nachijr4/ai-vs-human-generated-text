# LLM - Detect AI-Generated Text

Develop a machine learning model capable of identifying whether a piece of text was written by a student or produced by an LLM.

### Exploring:
- GPT2.ipynb (We explored the GPT2 model an decided not to use in zero shot classification)

### Zero-shot classification:
- bloom.ipynb - Bloom
- MistralAi.ipynb - Mistral
- f_llama2_genre.py - Llama2 for genre based classification
- f_llama2_genre.py - Llama2 for test classification

### Finetuning:
- f_llama2_genre.py - Llama2 for genre based classification
- f_llama2_genre.py - Llama2 for test classification
We used the same code but loaded the fine-tuned model
